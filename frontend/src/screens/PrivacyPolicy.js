      What we do with your personally identifiable information

      It is always up to you whether to disclose personally identifiable information to us, although if you select not to do so, 
      we reserve the right not to register you as a user or provide you with any products or services. 
      “Personally identifiable information” means information that can be used to identify you as an individual, such as, for example:

        </li>
        <li>
        Take commercially reasonable precautions to protect the information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction
        </li>
        <li>
        Not use or disclose the information except
        </li>
        <li>
        As necessary to provide services or products you have ordered, such as (for example) by providing it to a carrier to deliver products you have ordered;

The successor organization’s use and disclosure of your personally-identifiable information will continue to be subject to this privacy policy unless (i) a court orders otherwise, for example a bankruptcy court; or (ii) the successor organization gives you notice that your personally-identifiable information will be subject to the successor organization’s own privacy policy, along with an opportunity for you to opt out (which may cause you not to be able to continue to use the canagoldbeauty.com Web sites). If you submit personally-identifiable information after such a transfer, that information may be subject to the successor entity’s privacy policy;
